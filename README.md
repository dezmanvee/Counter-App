# Counter-App
This is a simple counter app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value displayed on the webpage.

## Usage
To use the counter app, simply click on the 'increase' button to increment the counter, click on the 'decrease' button to decrement the counter, and click on the 'reset' button to set the counter to 0.

The counter value is displayed in the center of the webpage and the color of the counter changes based on the value of the counter. If the counter is negative, the color of the counter is red. If the counter is positive, the color of the counter is green. If the counter is 0, the color of the counter is the default color.

## Installation
To install the counter app, simply download the code from the GitHub repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. Alternatively, you can clone the repository using the command: `git clone https://github.com/dezmanvee/Counter-App.git`
